fragman
=======

Terrible Experiment in importing code fragments (i.e. lone functions) into the global namespace. Really unpythonic and a great way to guarantee spaghetti code. Don't use this. Really.

I can't even remember...

It goes something like you ```import fragman``` and then you use ```pull('fragment_name')``` to get a fragment.

To update the fragments manifest you run ```python bin/update_fragments_manifest.py <manifest_path> <fragments_path>```.

Clearly I was thinking something wierd when I wrote this and this abomination should never have happenned.
